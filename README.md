## How to use it ##

0. Java 8u60 or later is required 

1. Get a fresh wiktionary backup   
Choose your favorite language and download the dump containing the current versions of article content [here](http://download.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html)  
Example for the english dump:
http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2

2. Uncompress the fresh downloaded dump somewhere
(Take care you need up to 5 Gigas of free disk space)

3. Edit dico.properties to indicate the language you choose, where the dump is located and last but not least where the dictionary should be generated.  
(Take care you need some free disk space to store your dictionary)  
(dico.properties is located here : dictionary-builder/src/main/resources/org/edla/dico/construct/dico.properties)  
**Nota 1 : If you are using Windows you need to escape \ like this : `C:\\some_folder\\some_subfolder\\some_file`**   
**Or you can use / like this : C:/some_folder/some_subfolder/some_file**   
**Nota 2 : If your language is not with a latin alphabet you need to convert the language property to ISO 8859-1 with escape sequences.**  
**Example for Nepali, you need to set language=\u0928\u0947\u092A\u093E\u0932\u0940**  

4. Build the project : mvn clean package  
(You need to rebuild the project each time you modify the dico.properties file)

5. Launch the program :  java -jar target/dictionary-builder.jar
